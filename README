theo - theo.c implementation for Tcl

This package provides quotes from OpenBSD's src/usr.bin/mg/theo.c.  The
quotes were originally spoken by Theo de Raadt, the OpenBSD project
founder.

The inferface of theo consists of a single tcl command named theo.
Because there is only this one command, the interface is not placed in a
separate namespace.

The *theo* command does not take any arguments and returns a random
string with a quote.

To make type:

      autoreconf -fi
      ./configure
      make
      make install

The configure script will deduce $PREFIX from the tcl installation.
The generated Makefile uses the file $PREFIX/lib/tclConfig.sh that was left by
the make of tcl for most of its configuration parameters.

The Makefile generates pkgIndex.tcl files that are compatible with
tcl8.5 and newer.

Usage:

      # load the extension
      package require theo

      # return a quote and print it to the standard output
      puts [theo]
